## Docker help

To see a list of common usage of docker CLI use the following command:

```bash
docker --help
```

## Docker Basic Components

Docker is composed of many components which will be needed to run, manage, pull and publish images and containers:

- Image: is a copy of an application, operation system or service that was publish in a public registry, such as Docker Hub, or your company private registry.
- Container: container is an instance of an image that is running on the host machine. One image can have multiple instances of the same container.
- Registry: is a private or public service to publish, download and manage images.
- Dockerfile: a file used to create a new container image.
- Other components: many other tools will be described used as necessary in this tutorial but, for the sake of clarity, we will only mention them when needed.

## Container Commands

These are basic container commands for pulling, running and stopping a container based on a popular existing image.

### Starting a new Container

This will start a NGINX container for the first time.

```bash
docker run --publish 80:80 nginx
```

**Explaining**: docker will check if an image of name nginx exist locally and download if it does not. It will routes the traffic from your local machine port 80 to the container port 80. If it succeed the container will run and you can test you application by typing http://localhost on your browser, otherwise, you get an error informing any problem such as bind error (if your local port is already in use).

To detach from the container terminal just press Ctrl+C. If it fails, you can list the running containers and stop it or run the container in the detached mode as described in the following topics.

### Listing running containers

To view a list of running containers type the following:

```bash
docker ps
```

Sample output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS                NAMES
cc3a0dc43716   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   45 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   youthful_wozniak
```

The CONTAINER ID is the short reference used to stop, start and manage the container. The NAMES field will list the names assigned to the container. They can also be used to reference the container. If you do not specify a name on the docker run command, as we did previously, it will generate a random name. Eg. youthful_wozniak. You can specify a name with the option --name on the docker run command.

ðŸ˜„ **Fun facts**: youthful_wozniak is a reference to [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak). Docker will create a a new random container name, honoring engineers and scientists, every time you run a docker run without specifying a name.

### Listing all containers

To see a list of all local containers run the following command:

```bash
docker container ls --all
```

Sample output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS                NAMES
c3ef23e3e9a9   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   About an hour ago   Exited (0) 59 minutes ago                           lucid_hoover
f61f3b04b56b   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   About an hour ago   Exited (0) About an hour ago                        clever_hopper
cc3a0dc43716   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   3 hours ago         Up 59 minutes                  0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   youthful_wozniak
```

## Stopping a container

To stop a container, use the docker stop command following by its NAME or CONTAINER ID. See the examples bellow:

```bash
docker stop youthful_wozniak
```

or

```bash
docker stop cc3a0dc43716
```

## Running a container with a detached terminal

The following command will run the container and immediately return to the local terminal prompt.

```bash
docker run --publish 80:80 --detached nginx
```

Sample output:

```bash
c3ef23e3e9a92828de363d7869f6043769ec27d046d503ba679a3ac6f4ac2285
```

The output is a full CONTAINER ID reference code.

## Running an existing container

When you stop a container by running the docker stop command, it will not destroy the existing container but instead it will stop it (putting it in a stopped state). So if you run docker run again it will try to create a new container and fail if the port is already in use or succeed if no other containers are running on the assigned port.

The right way to start a stopped container is by running the docker start command, following by the container NAME or CONTAINER ID.

Fo example:

```bash
docker start youthful_wozniak
```

## Docker Desktop GUI

The Docker Desktop GUI can also be used to manage, start and stop containers On Windows and Mac. See the following links:

- [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/)
